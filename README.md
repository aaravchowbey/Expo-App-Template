# Expo-App-Template
- A starter template for quickly setting up an Expo React Native app.

## Why Did I Make This?
- Created to support my mentee in the Clemson Forge program.
- It can be hard to understand how to get started with React and how it works.
- This template helps newcomers understand the basics of React Native and frontend development by providing a ready-to-use, minimal setup.

## Getting started
```
npx create-expo-app --template blank

npm install react-native-paper

npm install react-native-safe-area-context

npx expo install react-dom react-native-web

npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
```
